SQL in 7 days is a fast way to ramp up, yet a resource to review over the course of your initial years as a developer (and more).

This We Can Code IT accelerated series uses SQL Queries for Mere Mortals in order to get a solid understanding of relational databases and SQL queries.

Parts of the 7 day series relate 1 to 1 with the Mere Mortals book.

Part 1: Relational Databases and SQL

Part 2: SQL Basics

Part 3: Working with Multiple Tables

Part 4: Summarizing and Grouping Data

Part 5: Modifying Sets of Data

Part 6: Introduction to Solving Tough Problems

The databases used in this book can be downloaded at www.informit.com/title/9780321992475 (at the bottom, look for the "downloads" tab and click to get the code files). You may also get these files from this repository. They are zipped and located in SQLQFMM3.zip.

Please grab the databases there and insert them into your SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) or MySQL instance (C# devs should go for SSMS / MS SQL. Others should use MySQL).

If you need to download SSMS or SQL Server, please see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213248.aspx and follow the instructions from there.

If you need to download MySQL, see http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Install MySQL and MySQL workbench.

I haven't fully tested this, but if you'd like to try online sql, check out http://sqlfiddle.com/.

Please use the We Can Code IT Bootcamp "sql" Slack channel if you run into any blockers.
